# Subset-Solver
Find all the words

A list (dictionary) of possible English words can be downloaded at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt.

Given this dictionary and a file containing a list of input words, write a
program that can generate all the words that can be formed using a subset of
characters from each input word.
